Issues are grouped by priority:

* HIGH: blocking issues and bugs
* MEDIUM: missing/new/incomplete features or services, major bugs
* LOW: scheduled improvements and minor bugs
* WISHLIST: well, guess it :P

** Resolve SNAPSHOT dependencies **
Only chemistry artifacts are SNAPSHOTS at the moment

** Maven Release and deploy on repository.sourcsense.com **
This depends on the SNAPSHOT dependencies issue.

** Add path property, everywhere an id is used **
Normal users cannot be asked to use CMIS document IDs in macros, while paths are way more accessible

** Tests for all Macros **
Tests do exist for each macro, but they are mostly limited to Velocity macros tests. Macro code is not currently tested,
with some dependencies to Confluence internals that are not mockable (e.g. VelocityUtils) that make the code not well
testable.

** Folder explorer should be able to actually explore **
At the moment the macro is limited to display the cmis:document children of a folder, this should be extended

** Named queries **
The Wiki Administrator should be able to configure some queries attaching some labels to them, in order for users to
just refer to specific content without fiddling around with technicalities.

** External Attachments view (using CMIS queries) **

** CMIS Navigation Services (Browse CMIS repository) **

** Write support - see it/IntegrationTestCmisPlugin.java in the branch **

** Code documentation **
JavaDoc are missing for big part of either public, private or protected APIs

** Test with CMIS providers other than Alfresco **
 There's some documentation coming for Microsoft SharePoint http://bit.ly/c9gN7b

** Spike on empowering the cmis-embed macro **
It could be possible to render content types other than text/plain (e.g. PDF conversion, Flash visualization, ...)

** Introduce some QA checks in the build process **
PMD, FindBugs, Sonar, Checkstyle, everything is better than nothing
