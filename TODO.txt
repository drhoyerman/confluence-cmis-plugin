** Resolve SNAPSHOT dependencies **
Only chemistry artifacts are SNAPSHOTS at the moment

** Maven Release and deploy on repository.sourcsense.com **
This depends on the SNAPSHOT dependencies issue.

** Tests for all Macros **
Tests do exist for each macro, but they are mostly limited to Velocity macros tests. Macro code is not currently tested,
with some dependencies to Confluence internals that are not mockable (e.g. VelocityUtils) that make the code not well
testable.

** Test with CMIS providers other than Alfresco **
 There's some documentation coming for Microsoft SharePoint http://bit.ly/c9gN7b

** Add path property, everywhere an id is used; easier to use **

** External Attachments view (using CMIS queries) **

** CMIS Navigation Services (Browse CMIS repository) **

** Write support - see it/IntegrationTestCmisPlugin.java in the branch **

** Code documentation **
JavaDoc are missing for big part of either public, private or protected APIs

** Introduce some QA checks in the build process **
PMD, FindBugs, Sonar, Checkstyle, everything is better than nothing
